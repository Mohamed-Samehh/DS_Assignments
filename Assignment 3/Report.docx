Bubble Sort: Can be implemented on a linked list. It’s inefficient (O(n²)), but works since it only needs to swap adjacent elements, which is feasible in linked lists.
Linked List Suitability: Works
Notes: Too slow


Selection Sort: Can be implemented on a linked list. It’s also O(n²), but works because you can traverse to find the minimum and then move nodes.
Linked List Suitability: Works
Notes: Inefficient


Insertion Sort: Well-suited for linked lists. It’s efficient for nearly sorted data and easy to insert nodes without shifting elements, making it better than bubble or selection sort for linked lists.
Linked List Suitability: Best choice
Notes: Uses list structure well


Linear Search: Perfect for linked lists. You can traverse node by node, so it’s straightforward and efficient for unsorted data.
Linked List Suitability: Ideal
Notes: Natural fit


Binary Search: Not suitable for linked lists. Binary search requires random access to the middle element, which is O(n) in a linked list. It can be done with a workaround (using slow/fast pointers), but it’s inefficient and defeats the purpose of binary search.
Linked List Suitability: Not suitable
Notes: No random access
